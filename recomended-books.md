# Recommended Java Books

[Effective Java](http://java.sun.com/docs/books/effective/) by Joshua Bloch_An incredible book. It covers _how_ to program in a series of tips. I refer to it all the time.

[Thinking in Java](http://www.bruceeckel.com/) by Bruce Eckel_A great book. It is the most comprehensive introduction to Java. Each example is a complete program.

[Java Thread Programming](http://www.programix.com/threadbook/index.html) by Paul Hyde_Great book on thread programming. Not thread theory, but how it works in Java code.

[Graphic Java Vols. 1 & 2](http://www.amazon.com/Graphic-Java-Swing-David-Geary/dp/0130796670/) by David M. Geary Comprehensive introduction to Java GUI programming. The **best** GUI related books on the market. The first volume covers the AWT, with several great chapters on layout managers. It has incredible coverage of GridBagLayout. The second volume is hands-down the best book written about Swing; it covers everything and it covers it well.

[Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object\-Oriented Software](http://hillside.net/patterns/DPBook/DPBook.html) by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (Gang of Four) This is **the** book that changed how object oriented programs are built. It is an incredible book. The examples are in C++, but the text is can be read/applied/understood without the example code.

[Refactoring](http://www.martinfowler.com/) by Martin Fowler Refactoring is the process of re-coding existing code to make it better. This books does focus on Java, but it can be applied to any programming language.

[Algorithms in C\+\+](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/) by Robert Sedgewick **The** book on algorithms. Sedgewick covers everything. Many of the algorithms are already implemented by the Java core library (e.g. hashing and binary search), but many are not. There are also _Algorithms in Java_ volumes, but I own the C++ version.
